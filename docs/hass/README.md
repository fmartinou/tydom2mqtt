# Home Assistant integration

![logo](hass.png)

!> **For more information, please visit the [Home-Assistant mosquito integration page](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/mosquitto/DOCS.md).**

`tydom2mqtt` can be integrated to [Home-Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) in 2 distinct ways.

?> Regardless the solution you choose, Home Assistant will automatically discover `tydom2mqtt` sensors using [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

## Solution 1: Deploy the docker image by yourself
Just run the container [as described here](/introduction/).

## Solution 2: Install the [`tydom2mqtt` hass.io add-on](https://github.com/fmartinou/hassio-addons/tree/main/tydom2mqtt)

?> [Please find here the Community Home-Assistant `tydom2mqtt` thread](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tydom2mqtt-delta-dore-custom-component-wip/151333).

### Installation to Home Assistant + `mosquitto` MQTT Broker

?> **MQTT broker** \
To establish the communication between `tydom2mqtt`  and Home-assistant, you need an mqtt broker;
[`mosquitto`](https://mosquitto.org/) is the most recommended one. 

### Create an mqtt user
The mqtt broker requires credentials.

That user does not require to have admin rights.

Some user names are reserved (e.g. `homeassistant`) and should not be used (you can use `mqtt-user` for example).

To create a new user, go to **_Settings_** -> **_People_** then **_Users Tab_**

![mqqt-user](../hass/mqtt-user.png)

### Install mosquito

You can install mosquito using the Home-Assistant official add-on:
1. From Home-Assistant UI, navigate to **_Settings_** -> **_Add-ons_** -> **_Add-on store_**
2. Find and select the **_Mosquitto broker_** add-on
3. Click on the **_INSTALL_** button

![add-on-store](../hass/add-on-store.png)

?> Please notice that the Add-ons are separated from the Integrations.

![mosquitto-install](../hass/mosquitto-install.png)

### Configure mosquito

Once the add-on installation is completed, you can configure it from its **_Configuration_** page.

You need to enter the mqtt credentials you've just created in Home-Assistant. \
(the documentation can be confusing but it won't work without a valid user name)

![mosquitto-config](../hass/mosquitto-config.png)

### Configure home-assistant mqtt integration

In the integration page, go to **_Settings_** -> **_Devices & Services_** -> **_Integrations Tab_**\

You'll find the mqtt integration provided by default by Home-Assistant.

This is an MQTT client that will connect to your mosquitto broker to receive mqtt messages to make them available to Home-Assistant.

?> It helps (a lot) debugging to create an easy to read Client-ID rather than leave a default random ID.

### Install tydom2mqtt

`tydom2mqqt` is available via an extra addon repository.

To add the repository to your Home-Assistant, just [follow the documentation here](https://github.com/fmartinou/hassio-addons/tree/main).

Then you can install `tydom2mqtt`.

![tydom2mqtt-install](../hass/tydom2mqtt-install.png)

![tydom2mqtt-options](../hass/tydom2mqtt-options.png)

### Configure tydom2mqtt

![tydom2mqtt-config](../hass/tydom2mqtt-config.png)

?> Mqtt broker host is `homeassistant`. \
(as you run this add-on as an independent container, `localhost` won't work)

?> Other configuration entries are pretty self-explanatory.

?> You may want to start with `debug` level logs to help you troubleshoot. \
Once your system is working, change it to `info` to reduce the log volume.

?> Tydom IP address is likely attributed by your DHCP server; please configure a static address to avoid any change in the future.

?> Tydom Gateway password can be a problem! \
Older Tydom gateways accept to connect without password, newer don't. \
Some people report that using the last 6 digits of the MAC address works, so others don't. \
Here is a (not simple but feasible) [`tutorial to get your tydom password`](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/integrating-new-2023-tydom-deltadore-x3d-zigbee-gateway-with-home-assistant-solved/537503).

?> A bug requires you to setup an Alarm PIN even if you don't have one; any 6 digits number will do the trick.

### Restart tydom2mqtt

After configuring the addon, don't forget to restart it.

Then Home-Assistant should have discovered your Tydom devices and entities.

### Troubleshoot

If Home-Assistant doesn't discover your Tydom devices and entities, try to debug step-by-step:

1. Can `tydom2mqtt` connect to the Tydom Gateway?
2. Can `tydom2mqtt` connect to the Mosquitto Broker?
3. Can `Home-Assistant` mqtt integration connect to the Mosquitto Broker?

Start by checking that the `tydom2mqtt` and `mosquito` containers are up and running.

From the host / Home-Assistant console you should see something like:

#### Troubleshooting `tydom2mqtt` errors
From **_Settings_** -> **_Add-ons_** -> **_Tydom2mqtt_** -> **_Log_**:

You can see the logs of `tydom2mqtt`

?> You may want to restart the service to get logs about the startup phase.

?> The important point is to check that your configuration is valid and that the connection to your Tydom Gateway is working.

?> Connection errors to the mosquitto mqtt Broker could also be caused by mosquitto misconfiguration.

?>  Check that the mqtt broker host name is valid and correct.

![tydom2mqtt-debug-log](../hass/tydom2mqtt-debug-log.png)

#### Troubleshooting `mosquitto` errors

Check the logs of your `mosquitto`add-on.

?> If any configuration error occurs, it will be reported at startup

?> As you run mosquitto in a container, the warning about __running as root__ can be safely ignored

?> The reported IP address is crucial to configure the other services and should default to `homeassistant`

?> To ensure `tydom2mqtt` can connect to `mosquitto`, you should find your __Mqtt Client ID__ in your logs

![mosquitto-log](../hass/mosquitto-log.png)

#### Troubleshooting Home-Assistant Mqtt integration errors

Go to **_Settings_** -> **_Devices & Services_** and click to the Mqtt Icon
![mqtt-integration-home](../hass/mqtt-integration-home.png)

You can there check which Tydom devices and entities have been discovered.

![mqtt-device-list](../hass/mqtt-device-list.png)

If not, you need more debugging.

To enable mqtt debug mode, you need to activate the debug from the landing page (see the last menu item **_Enable Debug logging_** on the left side of the GUI.

Then you need to reload the configuration (by clicking the vertical **_..._** on the right up corner of the GUI).

1. Reload
2. Download diagnostic
3. Open Log File in a text Editor.

The interesting part starts around line 70; you should see connection details to the mqtt broker and then the device discovery.

#### Troubleshooting Mqtt messages

You can install the MQTT Explorer add-on by following the [installation documentation here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/addon-mqtt-explorer-new-version/603739).

![mqtt-explorer-connect](../hass/mqtt-explorer-connect.png)

![mqtt-explorer-UI](../hass/mqtt-explorer-UI.png)

#### Configuration back-up

Once that your system is working you're encouraged to back it up.

?> Home-Assistant does not backup the add-on configurations.

The more efficient ways are to create Docker container snapshots or VM snapshots.

?> [You can get some inspiration from there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22378777/how-to-take-container-snapshots-in-docker).
